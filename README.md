## Usage

Cloud solution launched as 100% free experience. You can [help me cut server costs] if you like this service.

This counter designed to be an analytical instrument for you, but not for people who are visiting your profile.
It could be used to see profile views dynamics as result of publishing new project, blog post or taking part on conference.

If you want to see big numbers in your profile, deploy a standalone solution, and you will not need to write a bot
and spam our server. Everybody knows that any counters could be faked.

> A billion fake views doesn't make you a very popular person, it makes you a person with a billion number in the counter.

## Is it safe to place tracking image? 

GitHub passes all images URLs through their [GitHub Camo proxy service](https://github.blog/2010-11-13-sidejack-prevention-phase-3-ssl-proxied-assets/).

This means that only GitHub can track personal information, such as visitors User Agent or IP address.
Third party cloud service stores only views timestamps and total count of views.
